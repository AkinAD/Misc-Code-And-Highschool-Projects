IN ORDER TO GET ACCES TO BONUS GAMES, A PASSOWRD IS REQUIRED  : S421781

WHY IS THERE A PASSOWRD ?. THAT PART OF THE PROGRAM WASN'T COMPLETELY MY CODE , FOR THAT REASON, I SET THE PASSWORD TO SEPERATE THAT PART OF THE PROGRAM APART FROM THE REST
I WASN'T SURE ABOUT HOW OKAY IT WOULD BE WITH MR. MYERS. ALSO, SEEING AS WE MADE THE PASSWORD PROGRAM IN CLASS IT FELT RIGHT TO INCORPORATE IT :) .
PASSWORD AGAIN : S421781
 WHEN ACCESS IS GRANTED,  IT LOADS UP A FORM OF BONUS GAME (OBVIUOSLY) THESE ARE WHAT AREN'T COMPLETELY MY CODE. BY THAT , I MENA I CODED MOST OF IT, BUT A NICE PERCENTAGE 
OF IT IS FROM THE INTERNET



P.S try inputting a wrong password 5 times  .-.
